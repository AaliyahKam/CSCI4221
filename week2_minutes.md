**Week 2 Meeting Minutes**  
**Prepared by**: Aaliyah Lockett

**Duration**: 45 minutes

**Topics Discussed**:

1. **Prototype Progress**:  
   * Created initial sketches for the **Severe Weather Alerts** feature.  
   * Prototype includes a settings page where users can:  
     * Select the types of severe weather they want to receive notifications for.  
     * Adjust the alert radius (local or regional).  
   * Worked on creating flows between user actions and admin interactions in the notification system.  
2. **Figma Development**:  
   * Began designing the wireframe in Figma for the settings page.  
   * Plan to expand the prototype to include the feedback and alert systems.  
3. **Admin and User Interaction Flow**:  
   * Defined how the admin will monitor user feedback and issue updates to resolve any problems (errors, missing notifications).  
   * Arrows connecting the admin to user interactions were established in the sketch (real-time feedback and notifications flow).  
4. **Next Steps**:  
   * Continue working on refining the prototype in Figma.  
   * Review and adjust use case details as necessary for each user type.  
   * Plan to test the basic functionality in the next sprint.
